- Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- Test across device sizes, especially mobile viewports
- Ensure touch-friendly interaction targets (minimum 44px)

### Content Updates
- Service information is centralized in component data arrays
- Testimonials and team information in structured data objects
- Metadata and SEO content defined per-page in metadata.ts files
- German language content throughout - maintain linguistic consistency

### Performance Considerations
- Images optimized with Next.js Image component and Sharp
- Font optimization with Google Fonts integration (Inter)
- Component lazy loading with React intersection observer
- Production builds include automatic code splitting

## Known Issues

### Browser Compatibility Warning
The development server shows a browserslist data warning - run `npx update-browserslist-db@latest` to resolve.
